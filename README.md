# Portfolio-Web-Page

Overview
Over the course of this module, you've learned some fundamental HTML and CSS skills. And now you're ready to use them! In this lesson, you'll build a simple one-page website and submit it for review.

In this portfolio project, you will write the HTML and CSS for a simple one-page website. This portfolio will give you the chance to showcase your new technical expertise and share some of your personal content and design ideas.

Remember, this is just the first stepping stone on a long and exciting journey. You're still learning the basics of web development, and you have many more skills to develop. But this project provides an important opportunity for you to practice—and celebrate—what you've learned so far. This project will mark your progress as a web developer.

Project description
In this project, you'll build a simple web portfolio to serve as your online business card. There are many, many ways to build a portfolio, so you should make yours unique and personalized. What's important here is that you use what you've learned in this module to create a website that you're proud of. Have fun, and be creative!

The example below is just one possible way to create a portfolio.

An image of a sample portfolio web page that introduces Jenny, describes her background, and provides contact info.
Requirements
Your portfolio will be assessed based on the content and technical requirements outlined here. A grader from the Thinkful team will provide feedback based on these requirements in the grading rubric provided below. Links submitted via Replit will not be accepted and will require a resubmission.

Content requirements
This portfolio will be reviewed by the Thinkful team. Specifically, they will look for the following in your portfolio website:

HTML code that is semantic and valid

CSS code that has been written by you, without the use of templates

Content that is clear and readable

An Intro section that contains the following information:

Who you are

Where you are located

An About Me section that contains the following information:

A description that shows your passion for web development and your willingness to work with others

One or two sentences that describe other interests you have outside of web development

A Contact section that contains the following information:

A link to your LinkedIn profile

A link to your GitHub profile

A link to your email (optional)

Technical requirements
Your portfolio must be hosted on GitHub Pages, and it must include the following technical elements:

Semantic containers like main, article, and footer

Styled links using pseudo-classes

Comments throughout your HTML and CSS that explain your code

The following HTML elements:

doctype, html, head, body, meta, title,
h1, h2, h3, p, link, ul, ol, img, a, hr
The following CSS properties:

background, color, font-family, font-size,
height, margin, padding, text-align
HTML validators
An HTML validator is a quality-assurance tool that can detect common syntax errors such as extra spaces, open tags, or missing quotation marks. These syntax errors could cause a page to render correctly in one browser but not in another. You can use an HTML validator to automatically verify your HTML page for syntax errors. You can then correct any coding mistakes identified by the validator program.

There are many web-based HTML validator programs available for free. One example is the W3C Markup Validation Service.

The W3C Markup Validation Service home page.
This service offers various ways to validate a document: you can provide the URI where your document is hosted, upload a file, or directly paste the HTML input into the provided text area.

Do this
Validate by direct input
Using the W3C Markup Validation Service, select the Validate by Direct Input tab and insert <div> into the text area, like this:

<div> in the text area.
Then press the Check button to start the validation process. When the validation is complete, you'll be taken to a page that displays a list of syntax errors that the validator program found for the given HTML input. It will look something like this:

List of syntax errors found.
Note that the syntax errors are tagged with either a Warning or Error label. Syntax errors tagged with the Warning label are unlikely to cause issues for your page. In contrast, errors tagged with the Error label are more serious and likely to affect how your page renders in different browsers if they aren't handled properly.

Go ahead and fix all the issues identified by the validator. Paste the following code snippet into the text area and press Check again.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
HTML validator displaying the following message: "Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show."
This time, because the HTML input is valid, the validator returns the following message: "Document checking completed. No errors or warnings to show."

Tip
Before submitting, make sure to validate your HTML file using an HTML validator. Then address any issues identified by the validator to the best of your ability.
