          <h2>About Michael</h2>
          <p>I've been working in the banking and financial world for the past 10 years after graduating college from Montclair State University.  
            During that time we've seen amazing advancements in software applications and other areas of computer technology, and I became interested in learning about
            how websites and apps are developed.</p>
          <p>Now I've joined the Thinkful community to begin my journey as a software developer and it's been so great!</p>
