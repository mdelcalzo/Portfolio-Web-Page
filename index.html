          <h2>About Michael</h2>
          <p>I've been working in the banking and financial world for the past 10 years after graduating from Montclair State University.  
            During that time we've seen amazing advancements in software applications along with other areas of computer technology, 
            and I became interested in learning about how websites and apps are developed.</p>
          <p>Now I've joined the Thinkful community to begin my journey as a software developer and it's been so great!</p>
          <p>If your looking for a developer that can grow with your organization, feel free to reach out!</p>
